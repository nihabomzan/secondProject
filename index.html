            <p>Hello! I am Niha Bomzan, who is passionate into nothing hehe, just joking. I feel I am a person that blends into everything without any special reason. I just love wandering around involving in everything.</p>
            <div id="more-content" class="hidden">
                <p>Besides wandering around, I love helping my younger brother and sister in their project works. That sense of making them feel like I am the one for them in need makes me happier. I used to love drawing, I still do but I am practicing it well nowadays. But if I have to do it for someone, I would do it more passionately.</p>
                <p>I believe in making people happy around me, especially someone near my heart. I love to show my efforts for them. I want to ensure that I am there even if others are not. Well, all I want is to make myself and the person near me happy. Especially my brother, he is the only one I want to see to be most successful and happy.</p>
